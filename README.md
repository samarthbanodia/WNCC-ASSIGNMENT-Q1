#### My Approach ::: 
this assignment seemed straightforward so i planned out the different functions and variables i need so the code is easy to read. Also i made a GUI for this part as i wanted it to be interesting - i used tkinter for windows, tables and button - i knew tkinter existed from school so just had to brush up the methods and tables. I made a dictionary for each participant which contains every detail so its easy to implement to understand -  events participated , current-rating, consecutive misses(for decay), events completed and similar for events as well.


#### Libraries i used , 
![ss](https://github.com/samarthbanodia/WNCC-ASSIGNMENT-Q1/blob/main/libs.png)

ttk is treeView module of tkinter it helps in making tables ; pandas for reading csv files , math for writing formulas and webbrowser for opening the broswer when "ReadMe" or "Linkedin" Button is pressed.

defining variables

loading data from the csv files with pandas and initialising the participant and events dictionary.




![ss](https://github.com/samarthbanodia/WNCC-ASSIGNMENT-Q1/blob/main/bias.png)
expected_performance -  calculates the expected number of problems solved for a given rating and event difficulty using the given formula.

generate_problems_solved - randomly generated the actual problems solved with bias to rating of the participant . I used choices method of the random library to put on bias.




Rating Update Logic:
taking inspiration from machine learning , i remembered how optimizers techniques like Schhochtic gradient descent , SGD + momentum , Adam update the their position on the loss function based on the previous data. Similarly i applied a logic similar to SGD + momemtum to update the rating

define the error delta as the difference between actual and expected. We define a learning rate and a momentum coefficient which scales the velocity . 

Uncertainity_factor stays 1 for participants who have completed 3 or more events and stays 2.2 if less. this helps newer players to gain more rating significantly faster.

First we add a velocity parameter to the participants data , it keeps track of rate of change of rating of the participant.

Here the for the change of rating i have taken a factor of learning_rate - to scale values

Velocity is calculated by the formula shown in the video , gradient is taken as the delta and uncertainity factor is also multiplied.

The Decay formula is fairly simple - if a partcipant misses >=2 events consecutively they get a decay of decay_amount for every consecutive missed event.

updating the leaderboard - sorting the enteries after each event and updating the entries in table . 

I have explained the code for tkinter window in the comments itself, take a look.
